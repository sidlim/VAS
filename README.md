# Web Visual Acuity
Low cost visual acuity system that needs wifi, a smartphone with a qr code reader and a browser, a laptop/tablet, and measuring tape to function. Demo available [here](https://sidlim.github.io/snellen)
Potentially cheaper than a commercial visual acuity system.

## Usage:
1) Connect to the same wifi on your phone and laptop.
2) Serve snellen.html from the laptop
3) Open snellen.html in the laptop browser
4) Scan the QR code with the smartphone
5) Measure the distance in feet between the patient & the center of the E on the laptop screen. Enter this into the first box "Distance (ft):"
6) Measure the size in inches of the calibration E on the laptop screen. Enter this into the second box "Initial (20/20) character height (in):"
7) Optionally, double-click on the laptop to enter fullscreen.
8) Test the patient's VA

## TODO:
- Font needs to be resolved
- Distance calibration needs to be checked before use
- Add other glyph sets & controls for multi-language/emoji support
- This list is not exhaustive; feel free to get in touch or fork if you think of anything to be added.
